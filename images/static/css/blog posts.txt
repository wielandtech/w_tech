Dynamic Programming

A rainforest recruiter recently reached out to me, and I began the mad scramble to learn Dynamic Programming. I find recursion and memorization quite natural to how I think, but dynamic programming quite the opposite. Where we somehow already have the answer, but now have to work backwards to where we started?

The OA was exactly what I had expected to encounter: Two dynamic programming questions; one medium; one hard. Never-the-less, I couldn't plop out two answers in the 90 minute time-frame. I'm curious how much time I should dedicate to this very specific interview skill?

I guess rainforest is saying memory is cheap, wrap it in a cache. Try again in 6 months? [GL to Project Kuiper.](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper)
